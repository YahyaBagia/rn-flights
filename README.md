# rn-flights

## Description

React Native app that lets users search for flights (Similar to Google Flights)

This project is a simplified mobile version of Google Flights built with React Native. It allows users to sign up, search for flights by selecting origin, destination, and travel dates, and view flight options with relevant details. Flight data is powered by the Sky Scrapper API (via RapidAPI). To optimize the limited free quota of API calls, the project includes a mock service layer that enables switching between live API responses and locally stored sample data. The app demonstrates clean UI, API integration, authentication flow, and overall mobile development best practices within a time-constrained technical assessment.

## üß© Explanation

### üîê Authentication Features

- **Login:** Validates user credentials from a local in-memory list stored in `AsyncStorage`.
- **Signup:** Registers a new user (if not already existing) and appends them to the user list in `AsyncStorage`.
- **Logout:** Clears the session and navigates back to the auth screens.
- **Auto-login on App Launch:** Loads the persisted session if a user was previously logged in.

### üß≠ FLight API

- Uses [SkyScrapper](https://rapidapi.com/apiheya/api/sky-scrapper) API from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)
- Has a mock layer that uses locally saved JSON files instead of calling the APIs.
